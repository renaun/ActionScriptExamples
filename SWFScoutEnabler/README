This AIR application helps you to set the advanced telemetry SWF tag on SWF files. 
This is useful for pre-existing SWFs or SWF not created with the newer asc2 compiler.
For example Flex applications.

Project references https://github.com/renaun/ActionScriptExamples/tree/master/RenaunsCoreLib

The Application uses Feathers UI library for the UI.

Implementation based off of the python script found here:
https://github.com/adamcath/telemetry-utils/blob/master/add-opt-in.py

Support for AS2 SWFs has a bug in Adobe Scout at the moment.
