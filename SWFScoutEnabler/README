UPDATE - Daniel Bunte(DuncanConroy)
A cmd-powered build can be found at: https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B2rWjDfJ1xAIUXI5d0RjZENCQzA/edit
if you have an older version of SWFScoutEnabler installed, you'll have to first uninstall it, or you'll get an "installation failed" message.



This AIR application helps you to set the advanced telemetry SWF tag on SWF files. 
This is useful for pre-existing SWFs or SWF not created with the newer asc2 compiler.
For example Flex applications.

Project references https://github.com/renaun/ActionScriptExamples/tree/master/RenaunsCoreLib

The Application uses Feathers UI library for the UI.

Implementation based off of the python script found here:
https://github.com/adamcath/telemetry-utils/blob/master/add-opt-in.py

Support for AS2 SWFs has a bug in Adobe Scout at the moment.
